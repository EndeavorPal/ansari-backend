Ansari is an **experimental open source project** that explores the application of large language models in helping Muslims improve their practice of Islam and non-Muslims develop an accurate understanding of the teachings of Islam. 

It is not always correct and can get things wrong.  The list below includes some of the issues we’ve seen in working with Ansari. 


# How can you help? 



* Try Ansari out and let us know your experiences – mail us at feedback@ansari.chat.

# What can Ansari do? 

A complete list of what Ansari can do can be found [here](https://waleedkadous.github.io/ansari-backend/).

# What is logged with Ansari?

* Only the conversations are logged. Nothing incidental about your identity is currently retained: no ip address, no  accounts etc. If you share personal details with Ansari as part of a conversation e.g. “my name is Mohammed Ali” that will be logged. 
* If you shared something that shouldn’t have been shared, drop us an e-mail at feedback@ansari.chat and we can delete any logs. 


# The Roadmap

This roadmap is preliminary, but it gives you an idea of where Ansari is heading. Please contact us at `feedback@ansari.chat `if you’d like to help with these.
